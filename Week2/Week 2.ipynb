    "## Lists\n",

    "A list is a data structure commonly used in Python. A data structure is essentially a collection of data values, that we can access and modify in certain ways. You're probably already familiar with the idea of a list. There are many different kinds of list: a shopping list, a grade list, a TO-DO list, a movie list, etc. In Python, we refer to a list with **square brackets**:\n",
