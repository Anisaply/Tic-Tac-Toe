You're probably already familiar with the idea of a list. There are many different kinds of list: a shopping list, a grade list, a TO-DO list, a movie list, etc. In Python, we refer to a list with **square brackets**:\n",

    "animals = ['cat', 'dog', 'rabbit', 'guinea pig', 'rabbit']\n",
    "animals.remove('rabbit')\n",
    "print(animals)\n",
    "Output: ['cat', 'dog', 'guinea pig', 'rabbit']\n",

    "```python\n",
    "languages = ['Python', 'Java', 'C++', 'French', 'C']\n",
    "languages.pop(3)\n",
