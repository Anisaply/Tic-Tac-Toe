To do this it has to make an assumption - that the opponent is playing 'optimally'. It is probably the simplest of these algorithms but can be suprisingly powerful.\n",

    "Nice job! Now for something a little more involved. The algorithm requires us to consider the outcome of every possible move so it would be great to have a function `nextMoves()`, which given a game board as the argument, returns a list of all possible game boards which can result from 1 move by the machine. Given a game board, the machine can place its token in any one of the blank spaces. Write the `nextMoves()` function, which returns the list of all the boards which are possible directly after the token is placed."

This is a recursive algorithm that traverses 'down' the search tree and returns a list of values corresponding to the scores of all the game boards possible after placing the token. What you do at each 'level' is dependent on the player whose turn it is at that level! Try coding the `minimax()` function. If you need help, try re-reading the description of the algorithm above and give our tutors a wave. **Hint** - this time, the function takes in not just a game board, but also which player's turn it is (`MAX` or `MIN`)."
